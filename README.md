## Planned Steps:
### 1. Organize data
Utilize numpy and pandas to clean and organize data.

### 2. Visualize data
Using matplotlib and seaborn, create plots and graphs to further understand the data.

### 3. Select features
Select features based on music theory principles and structure of the data.

### 4. Train a model
Use SciKitLearn to train the model with multiple algorithms including linear regression and
logistic regression. 

### 5. Further steps:
-Learn how to use deep learning and neural networks to improve the accurace of the model.
-Pull API data from Spotify and modify the algorithm in order to create music based on user selected songs/most listened to.
-Create mobile/web app to allow users to listen to their music.
